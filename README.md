# TDD

## Mistakes

- thought the basic component was card but forgot you need suite and value.

- forgot to change the return value from hearts to displayName.

- made a mistake in the test and put suite as a variable name instead of value.

- in the decks shuffle method we found few errors in the test logic. The cards were in a hidden state and forgot to show the and because of that the shuffle test didn't work.
